# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensions - Deploy SAP Cloud Platform Fiori App to SAP S/4HANA Cloud
This simple Fiori UI sample application showcases an extension to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. It lists the actual stock movement information (from a custom CDS view) with extended material information (from a custom field).<br/> This very simple app is to be seen in the context of the overall scenario which takes up several focal extensibility topics. The scenario is rather to show how you can do in-app extensions on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, expose a service from a Custom CDS view and consume this service in a custom SAP Fiori UI on SAP Cloud Platform. Furthermore, the scenario includes the topic of deploying the custom UI from SAP Cloud Platform to SAP S/4HANA Cloud as well as a description on transporting extensions from a quality to a productive system.
